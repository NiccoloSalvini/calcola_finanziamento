## Deployment happens
On the shiny sever <span style="font-size:larger;">[`HERE`](http://niccolosalvini.shinyapps.io/calcola_finanziamento)</span>


## Description
I noticed that people in the business of assessing _usury_ are using old tools such as Excel and 90' visualization, not even interactive. The point is to make it easier to non technicals to percieve the differences among appling different mortages schemes.
  
I have 2 configurations for mortages:

  - italiano
  
  - francese

I have 2 configuations for interest rates.

  - simple
    
  - composed

## Visuals

## Usage
You just need to type data from you financial summary, such as the total amount for the moratge, years according to which you have to repy it, the type of payment (3 months, 6 months, whatever), and all the other info required to compute a term structure.
